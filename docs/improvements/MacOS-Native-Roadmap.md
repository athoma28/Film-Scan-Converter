# macOS Native App Roadmap

**Goal:** Rewrite Film Scan Converter as a native macOS application (Swift +
SwiftUI) with pixel-identical output for shared Python behavior, deterministic
tested output for new native grading features, better performance, and a modern
Cocoa UI.

> **Status:** This is the detailed technical design reference. The authoritative
> current step, verified progress, limitations, and next work are maintained in
> [Native macOS Development](../development/native-macos.md).

## Current Position

Development is currently finishing the real-time still-preview exception in
Phase 2 before returning to Phase 1 engine equivalence. Histogram equalisation
is the next engine-equivalence stage.

Completed foundations:

- Swift Package Manager `FilmScanEngine` library and `FilmScanConverterMac` app.
- Frozen Python-generated fixtures consumed by exact-pixel Swift tests.
- Pixel-equivalent rotate, flip, frame, and aspect-ratio helpers.
- Native standard-image decoding and a thread-safe LibRaw bridge with exact
  RawPy-equivalent representative RAF proxy and full-resolution outputs.
- Threshold generation: `get_threshold` with exact pixel equality for 5
  dark/light parameter combinations, covering `convertScaleAbs` (16→8 bit),
  BGR-to-grayscale (OpenCV fixed-point coefficients), `inRange` binary
  thresholding, and 7×7 binary erosion (2 iterations).
- `shrink_box` coordinate math matching Python float32 precision.
- Float64 NPY fixture loading for intermediate floating-point pipeline stages.
- White balance (`wb_adjust_coeff`) with exact float64 equality for 4
  temp/tint settings.
- Saturation adjustment (`sat_adjust`) via RGB↔HSV conversion with documented
  ≤1 LSB tolerance for 5 saturation levels.
- Exposure adjustment with exact Python float32-rounding equivalence for 5
  parameter combinations.
- Main-window file drag and drop plus per-file correction controls.
- A reusable 16-bit Core Image/Metal still-preview renderer with live bindings
  and bounded latest-value-wins scheduling.
- Optional AVFoundation/Core Image live camera preview prototype.
- macOS CI that tests the engine and builds the app.

The immediate goal is to finish the still-preview latency and visual-equivalence
gates. Histogram equalisation follows, then contour detection and perspective
warp. Nothing later in this roadmap should be interpreted as implemented unless
the status page says it is.

### Next Implementation Step: Still-Preview Equivalence And Latency Gate

Before adding more correction controls or returning to engine stages, make the
current GPU preview measurable:

1. Compare `StillPreviewRenderer` against `FilmProcessing.correctedPreview`
   across a representative parameter grid and RAF proxy corpus.
2. Record maximum and mean per-channel differences and enforce a documented
   preview tolerance.
3. Add `os_signpost` intervals and counters for parameter submission, frame
   display, dropped snapshots, and end-to-end latency.
4. Verify a 500-update burst keeps only the newest pending snapshot and creates
   no render backlog.
5. Require p95 parameter-to-display latency below 33 ms before proceeding.

The following increment is direct Metal-backed display plus the idle
authoritative CPU render. Histogram equalisation resumes after the real-time
preview gate is complete.

---

## Phase 0: Test Harness — Pixel-Equivalence Gate

Every macOS rewrite commit must pass against a frozen reference corpus. No pixel may differ beyond documented tolerance.

### 0.1 Snapshot Corpus

Generate a locked set of intermediate and final outputs from the Python app:

| Snapshot type | What | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic images | `np.random.default_rng(0).integers(0, 65536, size=(H, W, 3), dtype=np.uint16)` at 4 resolutions (240×360, 2000×3000, 4000×6000, 8000×12000) | 4 images |
| Real RAW corpus | 5 RAF files from `sample-raw/` (DSCF0669, DSCF0718, DSCF0729, DSCF2417, DSCF2422) | 5 images |
| Intermediate stages | RAW (after RawPy decode + black border trim), threshold, contour image, histogram, histogram EQ result, exposure result, WB result, final export | ~8 per image |
| Parameter grid | Each parameter varied across its full range at representative points | ~200 variants |

### 0.2 Snapshot Format

Save as 16-bit PNG or uncompressed NPY with an accompanying JSON metadata file containing:
- Input image hash (SHA-256)
- Full parameter set (all `processing_parameters` + `class_parameters`)
- Pipeline stage name
- Output image hash (SHA-256 of raw bytes)
- Rendering time (wall clock, milliseconds)

### 0.3 Test Harness Architecture

```
Swift Test Target (XCTest)
├── FixtureLoader
│   ├── loads .npy / .png input
│   ├── loads expected_output.npy
│   └── loads metadata.json
├── PipelineVerifier
│   └── for each stage:
│         input → Swift implementation → output
│         assert output ≈ expected (exact bit match or ≤1 LSB tolerance)
│         assert render_time ≤ 2× Python baseline
└── RegressionGate (CI blocking step)
    └── must pass before any macOS-native merge
```

### 0.4 Pixel-Equality Policy

- **First pass:** Exact bit-for-bit equality (`UInt16` arrays)
- **Where floating-point accumulates differently (e.g. `pow`, `divide`):** Tolerance of ≤1 LSB in 16-bit (`±1` in `UInt16` range) with per-stage documented waivers
- **OpenCV operations (`warpPerspective`, `inpaint`, `threshold`):** Must match exactly — these are deterministic algorithms with well-defined behaviour. Note that `inpaint` (Telea FMM) is numerically sensitive; start with OpenCV interop for correctness.
- **Histogram equalisation:** Exact match for percentile-based calculations; OK to differ at floating-point accumulation edges only (document each waiver). The Python code uses `np.percentile` with linear interpolation; replicate exactly.
- **Native-only grading features:** Define the authoritative CPU math first,
  freeze identity and parameter-grid fixtures, then require the GPU preview to
  stay within a documented tolerance.

### 0.5 Performance Baseline

Record minimum/median times for each pipeline stage on the reference corpus running Python. The Swift version must match or exceed these before any feature work begins.

**Core processing pipeline stages** (called within `process()`):

- `get_threshold` — crop detection (grayscale + threshold + erode)
- `find_optimal_crop` — contour extraction + minAreaRect
- `crop` — perspective warp with homography
- `hist_EQ` — percentile-based histogram equalization
- `wb_adjust_coeff` — coefficient-based white balance
- `exposure` — gamma + shadows + highlights
- `sat_adjust` — RGB→HSV→multiply saturation→HSV→RGB
- `find_dust` — threshold + dilate/erode + contour area filter
- `fill_dust` — per-channel Telea FMM inpainting

**Display/output stages** (called within `get_IMG()`, not part of core processing):

- `draw_histogram` — per-channel histogram visualization
- `add_frame` — white border + aspect ratio pad

Benchmark full pipeline cold (no caches) and warm (cached crop + histogram stats + dust mask).

---

## Phase 1: Image Processing Engine — Swift Port

Port `RawProcessing.py` (769 lines) to pure Swift, with zero UI. Deliverable: a Swift Package Manager library `FilmScanEngine`.

### 1.1 RAW Decoding

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `rawpy.imread` + `raw.postprocess` | LibRaw (C library, manual Swift bindings via module map) or `RAWKit` |
| Half-size proxy (`half_size=True`) | LibRaw's built-in half-size output (`imgdata.sizes.iwidth/2`, `imgdata.sizes.iheight/2`) |

**Dependencies:** LibRaw (via XCFramework or Homebrew + bridging header). Must use identical demosaic algorithm, gamma curve, white balance multipliers, and output colour space as RawPy's default `postprocess` call.

**Fallback path:** `cv2.imread` for non-RAW → `CGImageSource` + `vImage` for TIFF/JPEG/PNG.

**Black border trim:** Port `findContours` logic for the initial mask-based crop. Python uses `cv2.threshold(src, 0, 65535, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)` to find non-zero rows/cols and crops to the bounding rectangle. This must produce identical crop bounds.

### 1.2 Threshold & Crop Detection

| Python (OpenCV) | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `cv2.convertScaleAbs(img, alpha=255/65535)` | `vImageConvert_16UTo8U` (Accelerate) with scale factor |
| `cv2.cvtColor(BGR2GRAY)` | Custom weighted sum: `0.114*B + 0.587*G + 0.299*R` via `vDSP` or manual loop |
| `cv2.inRange()` | `vImage` lookup table or manual threshold sweep |
| `cv2.erode(kernel=(7,7), iterations=2)` | `vImageErode_Planar8` with a 7×7 kernel, applied twice |
| `cv2.findContours(mode=RETR_EXTERNAL, method=CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)` | Custom boundary-following (Suzuki-Abe algorithm) or `Vision` framework `VNDetectContoursRequest`. **Warning:** Vision returns a different contour format than OpenCV; pixel-identical results require a manual Suzuki-Abe implementation. |
| `cv2.minAreaRect()` | Rotating calipers algorithm over convex hull |
| `cv2.boxPoints()` | Manual trig from (center, size, angle) to 4 corner points |

**Key requirement:** `findContours` + `minAreaRect` must return the exact same rectangle as OpenCV. This is the most likely divergence point. Lock with a dedicated test suite over all corpus images and all rotation angles (0–359° in 1° increments).

### 1.3 Perspective Warp (Crop)

| Python (OpenCV) | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)` | Solve 3×3 homography via DLT (direct linear transform) using SVD. Four point correspondences → 8 equations → solve `Ah = 0`. |
| `cv2.warpPerspective()` | `vImageWarpPerspective_ARGB8888` / `vImageWarpPerspective_Planar8` (Accelerate) for 8-bit; custom Metal compute shader for 16-bit with bilinear interpolation |

Must match OpenCV's `WARP_INVERSE_MAP` behaviour and interpolation (`INTER_LINEAR`). Test at rotation angles 0–359°.

### 1.4 Histogram Equalization

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `np.percentile(sample, pct, axis=(0,1))` | Full sort + linear interpolation — `vDSP` sort each channel, then pick the nearest/between values at the percentile positions |
| `np.divide(... out=..., where=...)` | `vDSP.divide` with zero guard (check divisor ≠ 0 before calling) |
| `np.multiply(img, white_multipliers)` | `vDSP.multiply` |
| Base colour detection | Same percentile logic, same `base_detect` modes (Percentile, Manual, WB Picker) |

Must replicate the exact `np.percentile` linear interpolation behaviour between sorted adjacent values. Use the same casing strategy for `base_rgb` / `film_type`.

### 1.5 White Balance

`wb_adjust_coeff` — 3-element coefficient vector:
- `[1-t/T+t/T/2, 1-t/T, 1+t/T+t/T/2]` where `T = 200`, `t` is integer slider value
- `vDSP.multiply(coefficients, img)` per channel

White balance picker: compute mean over masked pixels → sum of pixel values divided by mask pixel count. Port `cv2.mean(cropped_image, mask)` directly.

### 1.6 Exposure

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `np.clip(img, 0, 65535)` | `vDSP.clip` |
| `img /= 65535` | `vDSP.divide` by 65535.0 |
| `np.power(img, 2^(-gamma/100))` | `vvpowf` (Accelerate) — vector power for single-precision floats. The exponent `2^(-gamma/100)` maps the gamma slider to a power curve. |
| Shadows: `coeff * min(img-0.75,0)^2 * img` | `vDSP` vector ops: threshold subtraction, square, multiply |
| Highlights: `coeff * max(img-0.25,0)^2 * (1-img)` | `vDSP` vector ops |

The exact polynomial coefficients `4.15e-5` (shadows) and `0.02185` (highlights) are empirically tuned. Preserve exactly.

### 1.7 Saturation

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `matplotlib.colors.rgb_to_hsv(img)` | Direct math: `V = max(R,G,B)`, `S = (V-min)/(V+ε)`, hue from standard formula |
| `img[:,:,1] *= sat_adjust` | Multiply S channel, clip to [0, 1] |
| `matplotlib.colors.hsv_to_rgb(img)` | Inverse HSV → RGB standard formulas |

Avoid importing a colour science library — this is a ~20-line pure math function. Write it inline with per-pixel loops.

### 1.8 Dust Detection & Inpainting

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `cv2.threshold()` | Accelerate lookup table |
| `cv2.dilate` / `cv2.erode` | `vImageDilate_Planar8` / `vImageErode_Planar8` |
| `cv2.findContours` (filter by area) | Same as Phase 1.2; filter by area after extraction |
| `cv2.drawContours(..., FILLED)` | Custom fill via flood-fill or Core Graphics |
| `cv2.inpaint(INPAINT_TELEA, radius=3)` | Telea's FMM inpainting. Applied **per-channel** (channels split, inpainted separately, merged). |

`cv2.inpaint` (Telea method) is the hardest function to port exactly. The Python code splits channels and inpaints each independently with radius=3. Options:

1. **Call OpenCV via C++ interop** (safest for pixel-equivalence) — requires a C++ bridging header + module map + linking `libopencv_imgproc`. Adds OpenCV as a dependency but guarantees bit-identical output.
2. **Port Telea FMM to Metal** (best performance) — compute shader implementation of the fast marching method. Multiple passes with distance map propagation. Significant implementation effort (~500+ lines of Metal shader code).
3. **Replace with simpler algorithm** (breaks pixel-equivalence) — e.g. median blur over masked regions. Only acceptable if the reference corpus is regenerated.

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (OpenCV interop) for correctness, then pursue Option 2 (Metal) as a performance optimization in Phase 2.

### 1.9 Helper Functions

| Python | Swift replacement |
|---|---|
| `rotate(img, undo)` — rotation + flip | `vImageRotate90_*` / `vImageHorizontalReflect_*` for 90° rotations; bilinear interpolation for arbitrary angles |
| `add_frame(img)` — white border + aspect ratio pad | Create larger blank image, copy source into center, fill border with white (65535) |
| `draw_histogram` — per-channel histogram | Compute via `vImageHistogramCalculation_Planar8`, render as overlay bars on the image |
| `shrink_box` — coordinate math | Pure `CGPoint` / `CGSize` arithmetic |

### 1.10 Caching Strategy

Port the exact cache-invalidation scheme from `RawProcessing.py:126, 258–267, 447–460`:

- **`_raw_revision`** — incremented on each `load()` call (line 126). Increments even if the same file is reloaded, so all downstream caches invalidate.
- **`_dust_signature`** — tuple of `(_raw_revision, img.shape, rect, border_crop, tuple(ignore_border), dust_threshold, max_dust_area, dust_iter)`. Checked before calling `find_dust()`; if it matches the stored signature, the cached `dust_mask` is reused.
- **`_histogram_stats_signature`** — tuple of `(_raw_revision, img.shape, rect, border_crop, film_type, base_detect, tuple(base_rgb), tuple(ignore_border), ignore_neg_border, black_point_percentile, white_point_percentile, black_point)`. Checked before calling the expensive `np.percentile` computation; if it matches, cached `black_offsets` and `white_point` are reused.

Swift implementation: structs conforming to `Hashable` for each signature type.

### 1.11 Multiprocessing Export

The Python version in `source/GUI.py:1063–1095` uses `multiprocessing.Pool` with serialised `RawProcessing` objects. The `__getstate__` method (line 709) excludes large numpy arrays from pickle serialization via the `memory_attributes` tuple (`'IMG', 'thresh', 'RAW_IMG', 'proxy_RAW_IMG', 'dust_mask', '_dust_signature', '_histogram_stats_signature', '_histogram_black_offsets', '_histogram_white_point'`). Workers reload the source file, decode RAW, and reprocess.

Swift replacement:
- `OperationQueue` with `maxConcurrentOperationCount` determined by a memory-aware heuristic
- Use `os_proc_available_memory()` plus `NSProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory` to calculate safe parallelism
- Each export operation: load RAW → decode → process → write to disk
- Cancellation via `Operation.cancel` + checking `isCancelled` between stages
- Clean up partial output files on cancellation

### 1.12 Advanced Grading: Curves And Three-Way Color Wheels

Add authoritative, deterministic grading stages after base inversion, white
balance, histogram equalisation, and exposure, but before final output framing.

**Curves:**

- One overall RGB curve plus independent red, green, and blue curves.
- Store normalized control points in `ProcessingParameters`.
- Define endpoint behavior, control-point ordering, interpolation, and clipping
  explicitly. Start with a monotonic piecewise-cubic or piecewise-linear
  reference implementation; do not allow curve overshoot to change pixels
  unpredictably.
- Build 16-bit lookup tables for the authoritative CPU pipeline and matching
  GPU lookup textures for interactive preview.
- Add identity, channel-isolation, extreme-point, and parameter-grid fixtures.

**Three-way color wheels:**

- Separate highlight, midtone, and shadow color-balance controls.
- Define each wheel as a neutral-centered chroma vector plus strength, with
  documented luminance masks and overlap behavior.
- Preserve neutral luminance unless the user explicitly changes luminance.
- Require identity at zero and bounded GPU-versus-CPU differences across the
  representative corpus.

These controls must exist in both the authoritative pipeline and the
interactive preview. UI-only approximations are not acceptable for export.

### 1.13 Export Formats, Including DNG

Implement TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and DNG output behind one tested export contract.

- Preserve orientation, dimensions, bit depth, color profile, source metadata,
  and processing metadata where the selected format supports them.
- Define DNG scope before implementation. The initial target is a processed,
  demosaiced 16-bit RGB DNG with explicit color/profile metadata, not a
  reconstruction of the camera's original sensor mosaic.
- Never label processed RGB DNG output as untouched camera RAW.
- Validate DNG output with multiple readers and require round-trip pixel,
  metadata, and orientation tests.
- Add individual and memory-bounded batch export, cancellation, partial-file
  cleanup, collision handling, and reproducible output tests.

## Phase 2: Rendering Pipeline — Metal / Accelerate

After the Swift port is pixel-identical, optimise the hot paths.

Real-file UX testing established one exception to that ordering: still-image
slider feedback must become real-time before the rest of the correction engine
is complete, otherwise the SwiftUI workflow cannot be evaluated meaningfully.
Use a fast, explicitly non-authoritative GPU preview while dragging and retain
the pixel-equivalent CPU path for idle verification and export. The staged
implementation and acceptance criteria are in the
[real-time still preview plan](../development/realtime-preview-plan.md).

### 2.1 Profiling Targets

Measure on 6000×4000 16-bit images. Hot paths will likely be:

| Stage | Est. % of pipeline time | Optimisation |
|---|---|---|
| RAW decode + RawPy postprocess | 40–60% | LibRaw `unpack()` + manual postprocess, skip unnecessary conversions |
| Perspective warp (crop) | 10–20% | Metal compute kernel with bilinear interpolation |
| `hist_EQ` percentile | 5–10% | `vDSP` sort + quantile; cache aggressively |
| Dust inpainting | 5–15% | Metal compute kernel (Telea FMM) |
| Saturation (HSV convert) | 3–8% | Fuse with exposure in a single kernel |

### 2.2 Metal Compute Pipeline

Write Metal kernels for the most expensive stages:

1. **`warpPerspective`** — Homography matrix as buffer, bilinear sampling with edge clamping. Target: 2–5× over `vImage`.

2. **`inpaint` (Telea FMM)** — Iterative PDE solver. Natural fit for compute shaders. Multiple passes with distance map propagation. Complex but large speedup potential over per-channel CPU loops.

3. **`histogram_equalization`** — One pass to build per-channel histograms via `atomic_uint`, one pass to apply the LUT. Use threadgroup memory for partial histograms to reduce global atomics.

4. **`exposure` + `wb_adjust` + `saturation` + advanced grading** — Fuse the
   per-pixel stages where practical. Curves should use lookup textures; color
   wheels should use the same documented tonal masks as the authoritative CPU
   pipeline. Reduce memory bandwidth without changing control meaning.

### 2.3 Memory Strategy

- Use `MTLBuffer` with `MTLStorageModeManaged` for CPU↔GPU transfers
- Stream RAW files: decode into a shared buffer, process in tiles if the image exceeds available GPU memory (rare for 6000×4000 at 16-bit = ~144 MB)
- Use `vImage` for operations that run faster on CPU (erode/dilate, threshold) — Accelerate is already highly optimised for these small-kernel morphology ops
- Plan the pipeline as GPU-only segments where possible to minimize CPU↔GPU round trips

### 2.4 Preemptive Throttling

Port the memory-aware processor allocation:
- Estimate per-photo memory: `RAW_IMG.nbytes * 4 * 12` (heuristic from Python code)
- For batch export: sum all photo estimates, cap by available system memory, bound by `os.cpu_count()` and `max_processors_override`
- Use `ProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory` and `os_proc_available_memory()`
- For CPU-bound work: `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform`. For GPU work: `MTLCommandQueue` with appropriate buffer tracking.

### 3.2 Key UI Requirements (Feature Parity)

| Python/Tkinter | SwiftUI equivalent |
|---|---|
| `ttk.Combobox` for photo list | `Picker` + `List` with selection binding |
| `ScaleEntry` (slider + spinbox) | `Slider` + `TextField` bound to the same `@State` in `HStack` |
| `CheckLabel` | `Toggle` |
| `ComboLabel` | `Picker` with `.menu` style |
| Scrollable control panel | `ScrollView` with grouped `Form` sections |

| Export with progress | `ProgressView` in sheet with cancellation button |

### 3.3 Views to Port

1. **Split view:** Left inspector panel (scrollable, ~320pt), right preview area (flexible). Resizable divider.
2. **Inspector sections (collapsible):**
   - Photo selector + import/prev/next/remove buttons
   - Processing: film type picker, reject toggle, dust removal toggle, global sync toggle
   - Crop & rotate: dark/light threshold sliders, border crop slider, flip toggle, rotation (±90°)
   - Colour: base mode picker, base RGB display + picker, WB picker button,
     temp/tint sliders, saturation slider, and highlight/midtone/shadow color
     wheels
   - Tone: white/black point percentiles, gamma, shadows, highlights, one
     overall curve, and independent red/green/blue curves
   - Export: file type picker (TIFF/JPEG/PNG/DNG), frame slider, aspect ratio
     picker, folder selector, export buttons (individual/batch)
3. **Preview area:**
   - Process view selector (RAW / Threshold / Contours / Histogram / Full Preview)
   - Intermediate stage preview (upper, smaller)
   - Final preview (lower, larger)
   - Histogram overlay when Histogram mode selected
   - Click-to-pick WB base point and base colour on preview
4. **Advanced settings sheet:** Demosaic algorithm, gamma curve, noise reduction params, dust params, JPEG quality, TIFF compression, processor count override
5. **Export sheet:** Determinate progress bar (current/total), abort button, per-file error log with expandable details
6. **Settings management:** Copy/paste settings between photos, reset to defaults, save/load named presets, drag-to-reorder photo batch

### 3.4 Must-Have UX Improvements (done during port, not after)

- **Live preview with zoom/pan:** `NSScrollView` with pinch-to-zoom gesture and click-to-drag pan. Python/Tkinter had no zoom/pan at all.
- **Before/after split:** Press-and-hold or toggle switch to show RAW vs. processed side-by-side.
- **Keyboard shortcut reference:** `Cmd+/` overlay showing all available shortcuts, searchable.
- **Dark mode:** Free with SwiftUI (adapts to system appearance automatically).
- **Undo/redo:** `UndoManager` integration on `DocumentModel` for all parameter changes.
- **Batch reorder:** Drag to reorder photos in the sidebar list with haptic feedback.
- **Professional grading without default clutter:** Keep curves and three-way
  color wheels in collapsible advanced sections while preserving immediate
  preview feedback and numeric reset controls.

## Phase 4: Performance Verification & Polish

### 4.1 Performance Gates

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Cold pipeline (6K RAW → export) | ≥ 3× faster than Python | Wall clock, same hardware |
| Warm pipeline (cached crop + stats) | ≥ 5× faster than Python | Wall clock, same hardware |
| Full batch export (10× 6K RAW) | ≥ 4× faster than Python | Wall clock, same hardware |
| Memory per photo during export | ≤ Python baseline | `footprint` / Xcode Memory Graph |
| Curve/color-wheel preview vs. authoritative render | Within documented tolerance | Parameter-grid pixel comparison |
| Processed-RGB DNG interoperability | Opens with correct pixels, orientation, profile, and metadata | Multi-reader round-trip suite |
| RAW decode + half-size proxy | ≥ 2× faster than RawPy | `os_signpost` intervals |
| Perspective warp (4K × 4K) | < 5ms (GPU) | Metal System Trace |
| Dust inpainting (4K, 3 channels) | < 20ms (GPU) | Metal System Trace |
| UI refresh on slider drag | < 16ms (60 fps) | Instruments Time Profiler |

Log all results alongside the Python baseline in `docs/performance/`.

### 4.2 CI Pipeline

```
Git push
└── GitHub Actions (macOS runner)
    ├── Phase 0: Pixel-equivalence test suite
    │   ├── Run Swift pipeline over synthetic + real corpus
    │   ├── Compare output hashes to locked reference
    │   └── Fail if any pixel differs beyond documented tolerance
    ├── Phase 1: Unit tests (XCTest)
    │   └── ≥ 90% line coverage on FilmScanEngine
    ├── Phase 2: Performance benchmarks (opt-in via env var)
    │   ├── Compare to stored baseline
    │   └── Warn if regression > 10%
    └── Phase 3: UI snapshot tests
        └── Compare SwiftUI screenshots to reference (pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing)
```

### 4.3 Regression Prevention

- Every pixel test in Phase 0 is a CI-blocking gate. No merge that changes output pixels without regenerating the reference corpus.
- If a new algorithm produces visually better output, regenerate reference snapshots and commit them together with the algorithm change, with a rationale in the commit message.
- Performance regressions > 10% are CI warnings (not blockers). The PR author must document the tradeoff.

## Dependencies Summary

| Need | Option A (recommended) | Option B | Option C |
|---|---|---|---|
| RAW decoding | LibRaw via XCFramework + bridging header | `RAWKit` (commercial) | `CGImageSource` (limited RAW support, no gamma control) |
| Image processing | Accelerate (`vImage`, `vDSP`, `vvpowf`) | Metal Performance Shaders | OpenCV (C++ interop via bridging header) |
| Contour detection | Manual Suzuki-Abe implementation | OpenCV C++ interop | `Vision` (`VNDetectContoursRequest` — different output format, breaks pixel-equivalence) |
| Inpainting (Telea FMM) | OpenCV C++ interop (safe start) | Custom Metal compute kernel | Replace with median blur (simpler but loses equivalence) |
| Homography solve | `simd` / LAPACK (DGESVD via Accelerate) | Custom DLT | OpenCV |
| GUI | SwiftUI | AppKit | — |
| Snapshot testing | `pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing` | XCTest with manual PNG diff | — |

**OpenCV interop note:** OpenCV does not distribute as a Swift package. Interop requires a C++ bridging header, a module map, and linking against `libopencv_imgproc` and `libopencv_core`. Homebrew's `opencv` formula provides these. This is well-understood territory but adds build complexity. Limit OpenCV usage to the two hardest-to-port functions: `findContours` + `minAreaRect`, and `inpaint`.

## Remaining Delivery Order

1. **Finish Phase 0 coverage** — Expand the snapshot corpus from the committed
   helper fixtures to synthetic images, representative RAW files, intermediate
   stages, and parameter-grid variants.
2. **Phase 1.1, complete** — Standard image decoding and the thread-safe LibRaw
   wrapper produce decoupled 16-bit BGR arrays. The representative RAF corpus
   matches the Python/RawPy reference exactly at half size, with one
   full-resolution exact-equivalence gate.
3. **Phase 1.2, complete** — Threshold generation has exact pixel equality for 5
   dark/light combinations, matching Python `get_threshold` output.
4. **Phase 1.5 and 1.7, complete** — White balance coefficient adjustment and
   saturation adjustment are verified against Python float64 reference fixtures.
5. **Phase 2 still preview, active now** — Next, implement the GPU-versus-CPU
   equivalence and latency gate. Then finish direct Metal-backed display,
   display-rate coalescing, and idle authoritative rendering.
6. **Phase 1.4, next** — Histogram equalisation (percentile computation +
   channel scaling) with a failing equivalence test before implementation.
7. **Phase 1.3 and 1.2 cont.** — Contour detection + minAreaRect (OpenCV
   C++ interop), perspective warp (DLT homography + bilinear warp).
8. **Phase 1.8–1.9** — Dust detection and Telea FMM inpainting.
9. **Phase 1.10–1.11** — Caching and memory-bounded export orchestration.
10. **Phase 1.12** — Authoritative overall/per-channel curves and
    highlight/midtone/shadow color wheels, then matching GPU preview controls.
11. **Phase 1.13** — TIFF/JPEG/PNG export plus the defined processed-RGB DNG
    contract, verified by round-trip and multi-reader tests.
12. **Phase 2** — Replace remaining measured hot paths with Metal or Accelerate
   implementations. Profile before and after each change.
13. **Phase 3** — Connect completed engine stages to the existing SwiftUI shell
    and finish the application workflows.
14. **Phase 4** — Performance gates, packaging, CI hardening, and polish.

Each phase should produce a verifiable increment. The SwiftUI shell may develop
in parallel, but it is not a production replacement until the required engine
stages and final export workflow are complete.
